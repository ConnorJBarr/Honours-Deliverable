My Honours deliverable for 27/02/2025. 

### Sunbird data
We looked at the activity of two South African sunbird species with regards to the time of day. These were the Orange-breasted Sunbird (OS) and Malachite Sunbird (MS). Six transects were followed (each 100m long) in mountain fynbos in the Bainskloof area of the Western Cape - each transect was randomly chosen, but no transect was closer than 200m from any other transect. 
The activity of each sunbird species was documented (either calling, resting, flying, preening, chasing or feeding), as well as the time of day (morning, mid-morning or midday). The sex of each individual was also documented.

Time of day categories:
Morning (05:30 - 07:30)
Mid-morning (08:30 - 10:30)
Midday (11:30 - 13:30)
